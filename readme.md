# Creating a digital version of the 2023 after-sales packages
This is my first web development project for the company I am currently working for. As a learner, I will use simple technologies and code as cleanly and simply as possible.

## 1) Project Explanation
In order to communicate about the services provided by my company, I wanted to create 100% online presentation guides.
These guides will provide detailed explanations of our repair and maintenance packages for the vehicles we sell.

## 2) Technologies Used
As mentioned earlier, the technologies used will be very simple:

- HTML for content
- CSS for styling and page layout
- JS for animation


I will update this readme as the project progresses.
